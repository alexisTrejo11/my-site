# Hot Partition

> One shard receiving disproportionate traffic — bottleneck for the whole system.

## What it is

- Causes: poor key choice, celebrity keys, sequential IDs on one shard.
- Mitigate: salt keys, write sharding, async aggregation.
- Monitor per-partition QPS and storage.

## Why it matters

Understanding **Hot Partition** helps you reason about trade-offs in production data systems — when to apply it, what breaks at scale, and how it connects to neighboring ideas in this section.

## In practice

- Map the concept to tools you use (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, etc.).
- Look for metrics or symptoms that indicate misuse or missing optimization.
- Cross-read the section index: [MOC](/learning/devops-cloud).
